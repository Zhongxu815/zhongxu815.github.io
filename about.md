I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and works as a research assistant in the Advanced Imaging Research Center under the guidance of Dr. Changho Choi. I am dedicated in _in vivo_ 1H Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and Spectroscopy Imaging research in human brain at 3T and 7T. He has developed novel sequences for in-vivo detection of challenging metabolites including 2-hydroxyglutarate in IDH-muated glioma and GABA in normal brain. Recently, he focuses on high resolution imaging of these metabolites using Echo Plnar Spectroscopic Imaging technique.

In May 2015, he cofounded Overseas Chinese Healthcare Innovator Society (OCHIS) to unite overseas Chinese peers, especially young innovators, from the fields associated with medical innovation, with the support and guidance of international healthcare experts to build professional and identity-based platforms for sharing information and resources among peers. OCHIS aim to create seamless connections to promote efficient communication between overseas healthcare professionals from various branches in global healthcare and research institutes, hospitals, and healthcare industries in China.
